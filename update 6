Next Call: Even though next week is Spring break, we need to work on this and see how we are doing. How about a conference call on March 9th     at 4pm   ? Santiago to set up again. Thanks
Also can use messaging for quick updates.  Need Ivan Phone Number?
See updated to Do List based on Dr Shankar requirements:
Key Discussion points:
1)	Update slides 
2)	Q5 Fragment software to be done and turned in by 3/9. ( hmmmm)
3)	Send in Plan of action and responsibilities to Dr Shankar.  ( A lot like we were already doing) 
4)	Q&A or test for good sleeping to get personal plan of action
5)	Decide on sensors and approaches
6)	Schedule?

Update:   Our presentation on 3/2 went well.  Thanks to Ivan the slides looked great.  It was a pleasure to meet the team in person.  The other teams did nice presentations also.
There were some good comments from the audience. They even said this app might have commercial possibilities.  Change the name from Doctor to heath care provider.  They liked the idea of a person plan: developed from questions and answers, and data. Leslie is going to look at this.  We need to find ways that people will want to keep using something like this. There are apparently several different reasons for sleep problems.  The SleepFit name was well received.  (Thanks to Charles).  Charles is going to look at the software and should work with Ivan to find out how we get slides easily into android software.  We got the shield from the other sensor group.  Santiago has it and one of our sensors and will try it out.   We should also look at recording and analyzing sleeping sounds, and wearable motion detectors. 
Need to come up with a schedule given that the last day of class is April 25, and for us April 22. Finals are from April 28th to May4th.
Even though next week is Spring break, we need to work on this and see how we are doing. How about a conference call on March 9th.  Santiago to set up again. Thanks
